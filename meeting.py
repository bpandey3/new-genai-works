Here’s a **clean and structured meeting summary** based on the handwritten notes from your image:

---

### 🧾 **Meeting Summary**

#### **Main Topics**

1. **Mock-up & Communication**

   * Discussed how the system or API mock-up is currently communicated.
   * Plan to create or demonstrate a **revised update** with improved clarity.
   * Prepare a **sample architecture** and **sample prompt** to show data flow and structure.
   * Ensure **10 ms endpoints** are achievable or benchmarked.

---

#### **Technical Items**

1. **Concurrency & Performance**

   * Ensure support for **concurrent requests**.
   * Implement caching to **reuse prompt responses** efficiently.
   * Cache mechanism should minimize recomputation and improve latency.

2. **Framework & Flow**

   * Mention of **Flask methods** — likely for serving or routing requests.
   * **Function flow** to be reviewed, especially around concurrency handling and cached responses.

3. **Prompt Handling**

   * Define rules for **same question = same response**.
   * Handle prompts with **lockdown** mode or restrictions when applicable (to avoid inconsistent responses).

4. **Architecture Review**

   * A **revised architecture** review session will be held.
   * Ensure mock-up aligns with final architectural principles.

---

#### **Next Steps / Action Items**

* [ ] Prepare revised mock-up and architecture diagram.
* [ ] Validate concurrency and caching logic.
* [ ] Add sample endpoint performance metrics (target 10 ms).
* [ ] Align prompt handling (reuse and lockdown logic).
* [ ] Review and finalize revised architecture in the next session.

Would you like me to rewrite this summary in a **more formal version** (for documentation/email) or a **concise version** (for team Slack or Confluence)?
